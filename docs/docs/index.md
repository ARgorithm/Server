# Server

ARgorithm has a common server endpoint where the community can create
and contribute their own ARgorithms. This, by default, is the endpoint for
the toolkit command line. But in case a programmer wants to setup a
local server for testing purposes or wants to setup a specific server
for their class or organisation. The following steps are to be followed.

## System Requirements

The server is built using FastAPI. The requirements for running the application is given below

- Python 3.6+
  - fastapi
  - uvicorn[standard]
  - gunicorn
  - jinja2
  - aiofiles
  - python-multipart
  - databases[sqlite]
  - python-jose
  - passlib[bcrypt]
  - motor
  - tornado
  - dnspython
  - pytest
  - ARgorithmToolkit
  - PyJWT
  - aioredis
  - prometheus-client

Use gunicorn to run as a production server. Docker-ce will be required if server image is being used.

## Installation

You can clone the git repository and install requirements from the `requirements.txt` file.

<div class="termy">
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/ARgorithm/Server.git
Cloning into 'Server'
---> 100%
$ cd Server/app
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
---> 100%
Successfully installed packages
```
</div>

or you can pull the image

<div class="termy">
```console
$ docker pull alanjohn/argorithm-server
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from alanjohn/argorithm-server
---> 100%
Status: Downloaded new image alanjohn/argorithm-server
```
</div>
## Configuring the Server

The application can be run in several different modes:

#### In-app database

No authentication or authorization services. Data is stored using sqlite database. By default, it runs in this mode.

#### mongodb database

No authentication or authorization services. Data is stored in a mongodb database of your choice. Requires setting some environment variables:

   - `DATABASE=mongodb`
   - `DB_USERNAME=yourdbusername`
   - `DB_PASSWORD=yourdbpassword`
   - `DB_ENDPOINT=yourdbendpoint`
   - `DB_PORT=27017`

!!! info
    If using a cloud mongo database like atlas which provides mongo+srv url as endpoint, you just need to paste that URL as your `DB_ENDPOINT`. You can ignore the `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` env variables.

#### mongodb with auth

Authorization on all basic routes. Data is stored in a mongodb database of your choice. This is an enhancement to the previous mode so along with the same required envs.

   - `SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey`
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL=sample@email.com`
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=test123`

#### caching

Caching on state generation when execution request comes on `/argorithms/run`. Uses [redis](https://redis.io) for implementing LRU cache. The following environment variables have to be set

   - `CACHING=ENABLED`
   - `REDIS_HOST=redis`
   - `REDIS_PORT=6379`
   - `REDIS_PASSWORD=notmypassword`

#### monitoring

By default, [prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics have been implemented and can be accessed at `/metrics` route. Programmer can secure the route by using the `METRICS_TOKEN` environment variable to add authorization bearer token. If not given then by default, there is no authorization required

   - `METRICS_TOKEN=yourmetricstoken`

You can check out the grafana folder in the code repository for a ARgorithm specific dashboard

### Docker-compose examples

Refer to the `Dockerfile` for the default values of these environment variables.
The repo comes with two docker compose configuration files.

- `docker-compose.local.yml` : runs application in default mode
    ```yaml
    version: "3"
    services:
        arserver:
            image: alanjohn/argorithm-server:latest
            ports: 
                - 80:80
            volumes:
                - local-uploads:/tmp/argorithm
    volumes:
        local-uploads:
            driver: local

    ```
    
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` : runs application with mongodb and auth and will setup mongodb database. A redis server is launched to handle caching and prometheus and grafana nodes are created for monitoring It will read environment variables from `.env` file

    ```yaml
    # Sets up multiple services to demonstrate how a server cluster would run with cloud storage, authorization, caching and monitoring
    # This file requires the existense of .env with neccessary variable
    # The docker-compose file is added for emulation of how the application can be setup with full functionality
    version: "3"
    services:
        mongodb:
            image: mongo
            ports: 
                - 27017:27017
            environment:
                - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=${DB_USERNAME}
                - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
            volumes:
                - mongo-data:/data/db
        redis:
            image: redis
            ports:
                - 6379:6379
            volumes:
                - ./redis.conf:/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
            command: redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
        arserver:
            image: alanjohn/argorithm-server:latest
            ports: 
                - 80:80
            environment:
                - DATABASE=MONGO
                - AUTH=ENABLED
                - SECRET_KEY=${SECRET_KEY}
                - DB_USERNAME=${DB_USERNAME}
                - DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
                - DB_ENDPOINT=mongodb
                - DB_PORT=27017
            - ADMIN_EMAIL=${ADMIN_EMAIL}
	            - ADMIN_PASSWORD=${ADMIN_PASSWORD}
	            - CACHING=ENABLED
	            - REDIS_HOST=redis
	            - REDIS_PORT=6379
	            - REDIS_PASSWORD=notmypassword
	        volumes:
	            - uploads:/tmp/argorithm
	        depends_on:
	            - mongodb
	            - redis
	    prometheus:
	        image: prom/prometheus
	        ports:
	        - 9090:9090
	        command:
	        - --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
	        volumes:
	        - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml:ro
	        depends_on:
	        - arserver
	    grafana:
	        image: grafana/grafana
	        ports:
	        - 3000:3000
	        volumes:
	        - ./grafana/datasource.yml:/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasource.yml
	        env_file:
	        - ./grafana/config.monitoring
	        depends_on:
	        - prometheus
	volumes:
	    mongo-data:
	        driver: local
	    uploads:
	        driver: local
	
	```

The environment variables in above compose files are read from `.env` file. You can create strong secret keys using

<div class="termy">

```console
$ openssl rand -hex 32
09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7
```

</div>

## Running the server

Running the application using uvicorn

<div class="termy">
```console
$ uvicorn main:app --reload

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [28720]
INFO:     Started server process [28722]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```
</div>

Running the application as a docker container

<div class="termy">
```console
$ docker run --name -d server -p 80:80 --env-file=.env alanjohn/argorithm-server:latest
server
```
</div>

Running the application using `docker-compose`

<div class="termy">
```console
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
Creating network "server_default" with the default driver
Creating server_mongodb_1 ... done
Creating server_arserver_1 ... done
Attaching to server_mongodb_1,server_arserver_1
```
</div>

## Interacting with server

1. Once the server is running, you can check whether its running by entering the public IP in a browswer.  You can check the api routes on `/docs` page with the help of FastAPI Swagger UI. You can get the api routes in json format at the `/openapi.json`.

    ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35735486/104831190-97d6fb80-58ac-11eb-92d3-bd7a6d823cfe.png)

2. There are two type of accounts in the server:

    - `Programmer`
    - `User`

3. The programmer account allows you to create and manage argorithms. The user account allows you to run argorithms and get states. When using the CLI [account new](/toolkit/cli#new) command, it creates both, a programmer and a user account for that email. The mobile application can only create user accounts.

4. Logs are generated in the server.log file which you will find in `/tmp/argorithm`. The `server.log` file contains request based logs for every path.

5. Application metrics are available at `/metrics`
